# Group1_Project

## Description

This is our Project 1 for the Monash Coding Bootcamp. We were tasked with creating a unique 
web application utilising the skills we have aquired thus far in the course.

We decided to build a Gig Finder web application utilising Apis from Spotify,
Ticketek, Google Maps and the one Renny used lol.
